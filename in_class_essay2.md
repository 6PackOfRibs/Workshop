Question: **How did the transformation of the City of God provide evidence for how social networks were central to Rio de Janeiro's urbanization during the 60s, 70s, and 80s?**

The City of God began without paved roads or electricity and was riddled with crime. There were lots of hold-ups, and anyone who tried to make a living there would likely either get robbed or have a car crash into the store with nobody seeing a thing. But then everything changed when L'il Dice attacked.

The demise of the Tender Trio was due in part to L'il Dice killing the residents of the motel. Clipper joins the church and is never mentioned again. Goose gets shot by L'il Dice after attempting to leave the City of God, and his illicit activities with the grumpy man's wife indirectly kills Shaggy, who was also attempting to leave the City of God.

When L'il Dice, now known as L'il Z, came into power, the city finally began to grow. By taking out all of the competition (except Carrot), there were no fights between gangs, and he punished hold-ups severely because there were bad for business. L'il Z didn't kill Carrot because Carrot was Benny's friend, and this decision made the war that happened afterwards possible. Drug production became more efficient in a super-linear manner, with a hierarchical system and assembly-line production. L'il Z paid off the cops, and became the top dog of the City of God.

Meanwhile, during all of this, Benny was out being a cool kid. Got a girlfriend, decided to move out and start a farm, and had a groovy going-away party. He had connections with everyone and was the reason for the stable balance of power. In comparison to the beginning where everyone had their own little groups to depend on, he had a whole network of people that encompassed all of them. In this regard, the connections between people increased much faster than the groups portrayed in the film. Unfortunately, Benny was too good a dude. He tried to leave on good terms with everyone, so of course he got shot.

And then there's Knockout Ned, who was just minding his own business trying to live an honest life. His girlfriend got raped, his family gunned down, and he ultimately died because he became the same person he wanted to kill. Ned was the textbook definition of a good person who got screwed over because the City of God couldn't care less.

In comparison, look at Rocket. He does absolutely nothing in every conceivable situation. He had the chance to avenge his brother, but he didn't. He went out with his crush, but casually let her get taken away. He thought about doing a few hold-ups, but everyone was too cool to mug. He let himself get dragged back and forth by everyone and obediently did as he was told. And finally, when he had the chance to expose the police corruption, he decided against it in order to stay alive. Good people and bad people alike cannot escape from the City of God. The only ones who might make it out are the ones who choose not to make a difference.

Afterwards, war starts up between Carrot and L'il Z and everybody significant dies or gets put in prison. With nobody in power, the Runts start the whole process up again with a bigger playing field. It seemed like the City of God was on a new path with L'il Z, but as long as the system doesn't change, neither will life in the City of God.
