## Response: Jahan and Rosling

Selim Jahan stated that human potential is maximized when the richness of life is balanced with the richness of the economy. He separated human development into two sides, the breadth measure and the focus measure. THe breadth measure is where you have different measures of human development side by side with each other so you have a more comprehensive idea of human development. Things like child mortality rate and infant mortality rate are included in this measure. The focus measure of human development has three dimensions: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Some of the issues that Selim Jahan feels should be targeted are: youth work, which is a big problem in a lot of different areas, and gender-related work, in which women tend to be the caregivers in most countries. Agriculture work is important because that is how most people are employed in most countries, and work during and after crisis is important.

Hans Rosling had an example where for Brazil, there was great economic progress without also helping the people's quality of life, whereas South Korea started made progress much more quickly by being healthy first, then making economic progress. He also had an example where the United Arab states invested in health, and made quick progress despite falling oil prices. Rosling's point is that we tend to focus far too much on the economy and not enough on the people, when both are necessary for growth. His point with the example is that focusing on health rather than wealth has a far greater effect than we tend to give it credit for. He also made a good point on how there is no longer any difference between "us" and "them" in that life expectancy and family size no longer separates us from each other.
