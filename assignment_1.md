**Problem Statement**

In the context of human history, there has only recently been extensive contact between vastly different groups of people. As the mobility of people increases, so does the spread of new diseases and strains of old diseases. As such, there is a greater need to track and predict the effect of the movement of people on disease as well. There have been many notable epidemics in the past few years, such as the 2015 Ebola virus outbreak and the more recent 2019 Coronavirus outbreak. The Ebola outbreak in particular spread quickly in a highly connected area with poor surveillance, which resulted in it even being spread to other countries. By minimizing the spread of the disease and properly distributing aid to affected areas, the number of casualties could be reduced significantly.

   Access to health care is a freedom not everyone has equal claim to. Living distance from health centers, availability of healthcare providers, and condition severity and perception are all factors that influence how likely people are to seek treatment. This study seeks to demonstrate the application of Item Response Theory (IRT) to modeling fever treatment-seeking behavior in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Treatment-seeking behavior is important to characterize because delay in treatment affects disease progression, management, and spread. This pertains to Sustainable Development Goal 3 and is relevant to the "long and healthy life" dimension of human development.

   The study uses IRT to examine survey items from the Namibia 2013 DHS to estimate the probability of fever treatment in the formal sector for children under five years. Travel time is estimated using a combination of mode of travel and an impedance surface based on multiple data layers, such as land use, land cover, elevation, and roads. Since the majority of people in LMICs access facilities by walking, they usually go to the nearest facility for treatment. There are cases where people bypass the nearest facility, even for mild symptoms, but for the sake of simplicity the study assumes use of the nearest facility. A Bayesian IRT approach was used to estimate latent characteristics of fever treatment. One feature of fever treatment is the decay in treatment with increasing travel time to the nearest facility. This is what motivated the use of probit models to characterize treatment-seeking behavior.

   23.6% of children under five years reported at least one fever episode in the past fortnight, and of those that reported fever, 63.8% sought treatment in the formal sector. The Gelman-Rubin and Raftery-Lewis test was used, with the Raftery-Lewis test taking a minimum of 55,318 iterations to achieve an accuracy of 0.0005 at a coverage of 0.999. "Overall mean probability of fever treatment was greater than 0.5 in areas with malaria incidence >1 per 1000 population." In conclusion, the study demonstrates that there is potential in using national household data to provide a measure of treatment using a Bayesian method.

   The increasing mobility of populations allows pathogens to spread faster, allowing endemic regions to be more connected to the rest of the world than ever before. The ability to measure and monitor human mobility, health risk, and their changing patterns across spatiotemporal scales is limited, especially in the low income and surveillance areas that endemic pathogens tend to arise from. With health being one of the real freedoms of people that need to be expanded upon, this study is relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the "long and healthy life" dimension of human development.
   The study uses mobile phone data to measure human mobility. Mobile phones have become increasingly more widespread, although some bias still exists in that they are in lesss use for lower-income areas. There are two types of mobile-based positioning data that have been increasing explored: call detail records (CDRs) and mobile location history. For CDRs, the data on infrequent mobile phone users can introduce noise, and CDRs cannot measure very fine spatial movements. Mobile location history data is better in that when mobile phones are connected to the internet, their location is recorded with GPS coordinates. Being passively collected, this data also avoids biases such as compliance issues with GPS trackers and recall bias from self-reported travel history data. That being said, mobile location history data has confidentiality and ethical concerns, which makes the data held by individuals difficult to access. Also, given that mobile phone users are only a portion of the population, there is a lack of representation for lower income populations.

   Despite the inherent biases of involved with mobile phone data, mobile phone data has great potential to quantify mobility and accurately estimate health risks due to the sheer amount of individuals reflected in the data. The large amount of data combined with the spatial specificity of the data makes it an especially attractive dataset for modelling the effect of movement on the spread of disease. Mathematical modelling, while not as necessary in areas which already have an abundance of current data, has a lot of application in low-income areas with low surveillance.

   Mathematical models are a given when researching the effect of human mobility on the spread of disease. In order to determine the effect of human mobility on the spread of disease in the past, as well as try to predict it in the future, the use of the best mathematical models are imperative. This study introduces a new impedance model and compares the performances of it with the gravity model and radiation model. This article addresses the "long and healthy life" dimension of human development, as well as Sustainable Development Goal 3.

   Mathematical models, while they have been in use for a long time, they are less useful when real mobility data - by means such as call and text records - are available. The usefulness of these models really shine in data-scarce contexts, such as during epidemics of low-income countries, when it is important to forecast the best possible allocation of resources given the scarce information. Mathematical models can predict mobility patterns based solely on population size, population density, and travel distance. 

   The study compared the mathematical models by generating five hundred spatial patterns using various area sizes and location coordinates. The study modeled the 2010 Haiti cholera epidemic with a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework, which allowed an evaluation by assessing the goodness-of-fit of the observed epidemic curve. Epidemic spread depends on both an individual's likelihood of infection and their interactions. Mobility networks play a big role in the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease transmission within a population, which account for human interactions. The SIR framework accounts for individual susceptibilities.
   The impedance model is a parameter-free model adapted from Ohm's law of electricity. It's actually quite a simple and ingenious method of estimating human mobility potential. Electric potential is equivalent to current multiplied by resistance. Therefore, you can calculate mobility potential by multiplying resistance (distance) by current (number of trips per day). The other models were also developed by comparison with different laws of physics. The gravity model estimates the number of trips between two places by knowing the population sizes and the distance between them. The radiation model estimates the probability of commuting from one place to another.
   The newly proposed impedance model outperformed the other models on simulated data according to aRMSE and bias criteria. The impedance model provides accurate estimations of human mobility, especially when the population is smaller or highly heterogeneous. Therefore, this model would be useful in providing accurate predictions of disease spread of an epidemic.

   Human mobility is important for pretty much everything, which is why attempts to quantify and map human movements is nothing new. Large digital datasets with fine details on human movements across a long range of spatiotemporal scales, however, are more recent. This article provides an overview of sources and features of datasets, as well as the potential for combining them with spatial epidemiological data to infer pathogen movement patterns globally. The harm the article is addressing is the spread of pathogens via human movement in low income areas, which is relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the "long and healthy life" dimension of human development.
   Air and sea travel records are quite detailed and accurate now. Each ship is tracked via GPS with detailed records of passenger numbers maintained. Similarly, detailed records exist for almost every ticket and flight operated on the global airline network. There are also more widely available census, household survey, and displacement survey migration data. Satellite nightlight data is available from space, and mobile phone usage data can be extracted from timing and location of calls and texts. Geotweets, social media, and personal devices with GPS also allow more detailed insight into the lives of people.
   There have been many approaches at modelling movements of newly-emergent diseases through transportation networks, Using airline data combined with commuting data to model the spread of influenza, smallpox, and SARS, satellite nightlight data to model measles, and mobile phone data to model the effects of population mobility on influenza are some such approaches. Pandemics are notoriously unpredictable, so no dataset or model can be completely relied upon to predict the spread of an infectious disease. Vector-borne diseases are even more difficult to model, due to the added complexity of adding a vector. However, it is still useful as a means to identify possible interventions from a range of scenarios.
   Each approach has its drawbacks, which is why there is a need to consider data combinations in obtaining a more comprehensive image of human mobility in different areas, and the development of a single or multiple sets of 'universal movement models'. While we may never have enough data to cover all spatiotemporal scales of mobility for all variables, the continued development of this field will allow us a progressively more accurate view of the spread of disease, among other variables.

   When people move, they bring with them diseases. With health being one of the "real freedoms people enjoy", it is important to be able to predict the effect of movement on the transmission of pathogens. Doing so will allow appropriate actions to be taken to help victims of or prevent the spread of an emergent pathogen. Movement can reintroduce pathogens and increase transmission of directly transmitted pathogens. Additionally, movement during “hunger season” could make it more difficult for existing health systems to reach the people who need it most. This relates to Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the "long and healthy life" dimension of human development.

   One less studied aspect of human mobility is seasonality. There are social drivers such as religious holidays and school terms, as well as environmental changes: timing of agriculture, livestock, and fishery. The study's main question was how travel patterns changed over the course of a year, and how that would affect the introduction times of pathogens into different locations. The data for this study was collected by mobile phone subscribership. "Using the location and timing of mobile communications, subscriber travel patterns have been inferred and used to understand general mobility patterns as well as the spread of infectious diseases" (2). The data was collected from Kenya, Namibia, and Pakistan, with most of the long-term data collected from Namibia. The study evaluated the role of different drivers of mobility across different population densities, investigating the amount and direction of travel, along with their seasonal fluctuations. The population densities were classified as either urban or rural, and travel was determined to be either urban to urban, urban to rural, rural to urban, or rural to rural. An area was designated as urban or rural depending on the socioeconomic differences between them, although it was noted that this was necessarily the best or only way to differentiate them. Overall, travel peaked roughly 3 times per year, with social drivers being the biggest factor. There was more urban to rural travel in December, and consequently more rural to urban travel in January. 
   The study characterized possible implications of seasonal travel on the spread of infectious disease with a simulation model of geographic spread, accounted for directional asymmetries, seasonal variation, and pathogen characteristics. Overall, the spatial diffusion model used had the greatest utility with high transmission pathogens; low transmission pathogens were much less predictable.
