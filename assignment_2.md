**Introduction**

The purpose of this research is to predict the spread of disease, taking into account the variable of human mobility. In the context of human history, there has only recently been extensive contact between vastly different groups of people. As people become more and more interconnected, the spread of disease likewise becomes more difficult to predict and contain. As such, in order to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (Sustainable Development Goal 3), there is a need to track and predict the movement of people in regards to the spread of disease. There have been many notable epidemics in the past few years, such as the 2015 Ebola virus outbreak and the more recent 2019 Coronavirus outbreak. The Ebola outbreak in particular spread quickly in a highly connected area with poor surveillance, which resulted in it even being spread to other countries. By minimizing the spread of the disease and properly distributing aid to affected areas, the number of casualties could be reduced significantly.

Amartya Sen's definition of human development is "the process of expanding fundamental human freedoms", one of which being the capability to live a long and healthy life. In the case of highly infectious novel diseases such as Covid-19, the ability to predict human mobility and its effect on disease spread can directly translate into allowing countries to better prepare and make policies. If acted upon early enough, it could be possible to completely contain and prevent the spread of a novel disease. If not, then the information would still be useful in flattening the curve and ensuring as few people as possible die from the disease.

Due to the significance of malaria in Namibia, a lot of data has been collected in the region, and much of the research conducted on the spread of disease has been collected from there. Therefore, Namibia is a prime country of interest. However, given the scale of human mobility, a lot of data has been gathered and used from other countries along with Namibia within the literature.

**Data Science Methods**

There are a few data science methods I found significant, one of which is the Bayesian Item Response Theory models fitted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation (Alegana et al., 2017). The study sought to estimate the probability of fever treatment for children under five years old. While the focus was not specifically on how human mobility affects the spread of disease, the study sought to model treatment-seeking behavior, which is also important to model during an epidemic. Item response theory (IRT) is used to examine survey items and characteristics in psychology and education. "IRT approaches are essentially probit models with additional regression effects used to aid estimation of item characteristics"  (Alegana et al., 2017), probit models being a type of regression where the dependent variable has only two values. The decay of fever treatment with increasing travel time to the nearest facility is what motivated the use of probit models to characterize treatment-seeking behavior. Travel time was estimated using a combination of mode of travel and an impedance surface based on multiple data layers, such as land use, land cover, elevation, and roads. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is used to estimate related parameters and estimate probability of the dependent variable. With a Bayesian framework, there is the added ability to incorporate uncertainty in estimating latent traits. Prior distributions can be imposed on the Bayesian probability model to capture aspects of data that are not included with descriptive and quantitative approaches. The paper also mentioned how imputation techniques could be used to compensate for missing data. Given how there is often so little data in lower-income countries, imputation techniques could be good to explore in this context.

Another method I found significant was the impedance model (Sallah, 2017). Mathematical models are a given when researching the effect of human mobility on the spread of disease. In order to determine the effect of human mobility on the spread of disease in the past, as well as try to predict it in the future, the use of good mathematical models are imperative.

Mathematical models are unfortunately less useful when real mobility data is available. Their usefulness really shines in data-scarce contexts, such as during epidemics of low-income countries, when it is important to forecast the best possible allocation of resources given the scarce information. Mathematical models can predict mobility patterns based solely on population size, population density, and travel distance.

The impedance model is a parameter-free model adapted from Ohm's law of electricity. Using the formula P = I * R, Mobility potential is calculated by multiplying distance (resistance) by the number of trips per day (current). In comparison, the gravity model estimates the number of trips between two places by using the population sizes and the distance between them. The issue with the gravity model is that it requires parameter tuning and is difficult to implement without reference data. The radiation model estimates the probability of commuting from one place to another and likely patterns of commuting. While parameter-free, this model assumes mobility to depend on population density, making it inherently biased. The impedance model outperformed both of these models when tested on simulated data. It provided accurate estimations of human mobility, especially when the population is smaller or highly heterogeneous. Given how the impedance model is most useful in data-scarce areas and works best with a smaller population, this model would be perfect for providing predictions of disease spread of an epidemic.

A study done by Kraemer (2019) used multiple mathematical models together, as well as an adjacency network. The adjacency network is one where movements are assumed to proceed along edges connecting each of the districts in the countries. It encodes the number of district borders one would need to cross to move from one district to another, which reflects the impacts of borders on movements in a region. All three metrics were used independently as well as together to capture effects that might not be described separately. The model did relatively well in predicting up to two weeks ahead. When tested in real time, the model fit and results were very similar. The invasion model was not particularly accurate in predicting invasions within a two week period, but when extended to a month, the model made accurate predictions of the invasion process.

**Significant Datasets**

The most significant dataset I found was mobile phone data (Lai, 2019), mobile phone subscribership specifically (Wesolowski, 2017). Mobile phones have become increasingly more widespread, although some bias still exists with less usage in lower-income areas. Despite the inherent biases involved with mobile phone data, it is still the most useful too to quantify mobility and accurately estimate health risks due to the sheer amount of individuals reflected in the data (Lai, 2019). The large amount of data combined with the spatial specificty of the data makes it especially attractive for modelling the effect of movement on the spread of disease.

Another dataset was the African road network (ARN), obtained from GPS navigation and cartography. A study done by Strano (2018) identified road connectivity communities and mapped bridge areas between communities and key linkage routes. Similar analyses had already been undertaken to map connectivity in air, shipping, and migration networks, but the road network is where most low and middle income people travel. While not specifically tracking the movement of people, having a connectivity map would undoubtedly be a useful complement in describing the spread of disease.

There is also survey data, which was used with the Bayesian IRT model approach. Although it does not have the temporal advantage offered by mobile phone data, it also does not have as much bias between areas of different incomes. It can also be used to gather information outside of just time and space of individuals, which could be useful for gathering data on susceptibility of individuals. There are other datasets, such as air and sea travel records, satellite nightlight data, etc., but they are not as significant in the context on human mobility, which requires data that is spatiotemporally accurate on a fine scale.

**Feasibility**

One question which begs to be answered is: How predictable is human mobility, and how well do current algorithms go to predicting it? If human mobility is random, then trying to predict mobility over a long time span would do worse than an educated guess. We would be inclined to believe there is too much entropy, and that human mobility is impossible to predict. If, however, we had a theoretical maximum predictability, we could be able to judge not only how well our current algorithms do in relation to it, but also how predictable human mobility actually is. Lu et al. (2013) found the theoretical maximum predictability and tested a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user.

There are many methods to predict human mobility: Markov chain (MC) models, neural networks, Bayesian networks, and finite automaton to name a few. Prediction accuracy varies according to the algorithm used and local context. One of the goals of the study is to measure how well these algorithms perform in regard to the best theoretical possible algorithm constructed. The highest potential accuracy of predictability, "maximum predictibility", is defined by the entropy of information of a person's trajectory, and can be calculated by solving a limiting case of Fano's inequality. For this study, mobile phone data was used. By combining information on frequency with temporal correlation of the trajectory, the upper bound of prediction accuracy became as high as 0.88. The MC-based models were able to produce estimates as high as 0.91, above the theoretical upper limit.

Maximum predictability was achieved with a first-order Markov chain model (MC(1)). It shows potential predictability captures the theoretical limits for the predictive analysis of human movement behaviors and provides an approachable upper bound of predictability for this type of mobility data. It also demonstrates that predictability of human mobility is high, and that this high predictability is achievable for daily population movement predictions. Human mobility is fundamentally not random, as individuals' movements are highly influenced by their historical behavior.

**Discussion**

So human mobility, by itself, is fairly predictable. People tend to live in one place, and move in ways consistent with their historical behavior. But what if disease becomes a factor? Not only do we have to take into account the spread of disease from one individual to another, which by itself depends on a variety of different variables, we have to factor in peoples' reactions to disease. Treatment-seeking behavior, the reaction of governments (such as the many country lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic), and the varying degrees to which individuals go to protect themselves. Some people might decide stay home and only go out when necessary, whereas others might dress up as a smurf and attend a giant smurf rally. Everything is constantly adapting simultaneously to the changing situation. In the case of Covid-19, every individual is modifying their behaviors, countries are speeding up production of resources necessary to fight the disease, and countries are collaborating with each other. Would it have been possible to predict how effectively certain policies would work, when countries would go on lockdown, how quickly masks would be produced and distributed? All of those are necessary when predicting the spread of disease. With adaptation being constant, varied, and on the scale of both an individual and groups of people, it would be impossible to predict.

So far, most of the literature has been descriptive. How can human mobility be predicted, and the spread of disease within that context? There has been a lot of progress in this realm, and it is possible we are getting close to the theoretical maximum predictability. The goal is to eventually be able to see the end of a disease as it begins, but if by nature of being a complex adaptive system, that is impossible, it might be time to change the question from descriptive to evaluative. With the information we are able to gather, what actions could be taken to minimize the spread of disease? Perhaps instead of just simulating the spread of disease on human actions, we could begin to simulate the effect of our actions on the spread of disease. I believe this would be a good direction for new research, and could vastly expand the freedom of a long and healthy life.
