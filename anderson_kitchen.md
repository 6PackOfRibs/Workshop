I agree with Kitchen more than Anderson. Anderson makes a good point that big data is revolutionizing the way we approach problems, and that rather than finding data to answer a question, we can use data to find correlations we might never think of otherwise. However, that does not mean in any way that theory is dead. While we may be able to find correlations and apply them, finding and understanding the underlying concepts, while perhaps no longer "necessary" in the scope of a specific experiment, is still an incredibly useful tool in experimental designs and such. Sure, we can run a program to gather data and extract answers from correlations. But how do we figure out what features distinguish between species and how that is reflected in the data? The more we understand theory, the more we will be able to accumulate the right data, and the more we will be able to extract from it. Data, like theory, is just another tool, not the end all be all of scientific thought. Only by correctly using them in conjunction can we make substantial, meaningful progress.
