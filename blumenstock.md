Good intent is the backbone of many projects in data science, but intent in and of itself does not change anything. That's kind of self-explanatory, but the point is that effect of actions done with good intent tend to have much larger consequences and implications in the field of data science, and that it is even more important to keep the end in mind before acting. As far as I'm concerned, that's as far as good intent is relevant in regards to data science and human development. Yes, good intent is important, even more so for data science than for other fields, but that is simply because the effects are much greater.
